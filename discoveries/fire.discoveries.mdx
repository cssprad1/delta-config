    ## Disturbed ecosystem
    Fire, either natural or otherwise, is a pervasive ecological and hydrological disturbance that sparks extensive impacts to underlying vegetation, soil, and the ecosystem. Fires modulate ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) by directly affecting the aboveground vegetation immediately after burning, thereby reducing transpirational leaf surface area.

    Western U.S. has experienced a rising number of catastrophic wildfires in the recent times, intensified by anthropogenic climate change and extreme droughts.

	We use observations of ET from high-resolution OpenET products and burned area severity from Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) maps to analyze the post-fire impact on hydrology and water balance.

## Fire's Impact on Hydrology
Fire leads to reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) which is modeled using Open ET observations. Difference in water balance (precipitation minus ET) over fire impacted region from than over a control unimpacted region gives an estimate of ET suppression caused by fire.

## Interpreting the data
The TWS anomalies are calculated as differences of raw TWS with the climatology obtained over 2001-2021. Negative anomalies denote lower than normal TWS and vice-versa. The trend over time is thus deseasonalized and reflective of changes due to human impacts.

## Declining trends, depleting storage!  
Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is defined as the summation of all water on the land surface and in the subsurface. It includes surface soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, groundwater, snow, ice, water stored in the vegetation, river and lake water.
