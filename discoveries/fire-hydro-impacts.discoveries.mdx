## When Fires Disturb Eco-Hydrology

Fire, either natural or otherwise, is a pervasive ecological and hydrological disturbance that sparks extensive impacts to underlying vegetation, soil, and the ecosystem. Fires modulate ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) by directly affecting the aboveground vegetation immediately after burning, thereby reducing transpirational leaf surface area.

    The Western United States (WUS) is experiencing an increase of catastrophic wildfires. While fires historically constituted an important rangeland disturbance process in the semi-arid ecosystem of WUS, climate change and intensifying droughts have increased vigorous fire activities

## Sensing Vegetation Changes from Space

We use observations of ET from high-resolution OpenET products and burned area severity from Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) maps to analyze the post-fire impact on hydrology and water balance.
Fire leads to reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) which is modeled using Open ET observations. Difference in water balance (precipitation minus ET) over fire impacted region from than over a control unimpacted region gives an estimate of ET suppression caused by fire.

## Loss of vegetation, increase in flow! 

Natchez fire, right on the Oregon/California line between Happy Camp, CA and Cave Junction, OR, burnt 38,800 acres in the fall of 2018. 
The mix of moderate and high severity burn scars adversely impacted the vegetation in the following water years, resulting in a significant
reduction in vegetation transpiration. The affected water balance subsequently contributes to an additional volume of runoff before the vegetation recovers to pre-fire conditions.
