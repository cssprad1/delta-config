Biomass in its simplest term is the mass of living (or previously living) material on Earth. Because life on Earth is carbon-based (e.g. we eat carbohydrates for energy), biomass is closely related to the carbon cycle. The biomass of a tree, for example, is literally the mass of the tree - and approximately half of this mass is carbon. When trees burn, that carbon is converted to carbon dioxide and released to the atmosphere; when trees grow, they inhale carbon dioxide and store it long-term in their wood, or pump it into their roots and surrounding soil. Mapping and monitoring Earth's biomass is critical to understanding how forests might help lessen the negative impact of climate change or make worse through biomass loss. NASA satellites keep a watchful eye on biomass, tracking where and how much biomass is stored in forests, as well as how much is being lost over time.  

These satellites can give this important information to decision-makers on global policy initiatives, such as the Global Stocktake, which is an integral part of the Paris Agreement. At the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, the world committed to ending deforestation, (clearing a forest of trees) by 2030. NASA satellites can monitor where these commitments will be met, where deforestation continues, and the associated impacts on climate change. Similarly, these satellites may quantify the effectiveness of reforestation, restoration and tree planting efforts to increase global carbon sinks. How much biomass is there, how is it changing, and why? These are outstanding questions that scientists are currently studying - and satellite data are central to finding the answers.
