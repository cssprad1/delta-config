During the heat of the summer, the importance of monitoring and tracking algal blooms becomes readily apparent.  Those flocking to the cool waters of local lakes, such as [those in upstate New York](https://www.wamc.org/news/2022-08-19/new-york-communities-grapple-with-harmful-algal-blooms),  increasingly encounter  the menacing, shimmering green of algal blooms covering the surface of the water. Beyond the contrast of a slimy green surface with an expected sparkling blue one, algal blooms pose real risks to both humans and wildlife in terms of toxins and the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the water. Satellite observations of algal blooms are essential to maintaining a healthy environment.
