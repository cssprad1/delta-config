Healthy and productive crops are critical for our planetâ€™s food security, and satellite observations play a vital role in monitoring and tracking the changes in the agriculture ecosystem. The data from satellite technology has the potential of achieving outcomes similar to that of the Green Revolution of the 1950a and 1960s. Researchers such as Norman Borlaug (who would win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970), introduced new technologies, innovative varieties of seed, and modern scientific methods of farming. As a result, worldwide agriculture output increased over 40 percent which is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. The need for such innovation has not diminished.
